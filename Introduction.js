    Q. Why react was created ?
        Ghost Message Problem 
    
    React is a library

    Topics : 
        
        1. Core of React
        2. Component Reusability
        3. Reusing of Compnent (Props)
        5. How to propogate change (hooks)

    Additional Addon to React :

        1. Router (React doesn't have Router)
        2. State Management (React doesn't have State Management)
            -> Redux, Redux Toolkit, zustand, context API
        3. Class based component
        4. BAAS Apps (Backend As a Service)
            -> using it can make Social Media Clone , E-Commerce App
        
        React is not a complete solution 
        -> No SEO, browser render of JS, no routing 

        After React : 
        Framework : NextJS, Gatsby , Remix

        Dcoumentation : react.dev   

                -----> React-DOM  (For Web)
        React  |
                -----> React-native (For Mobile Dev)
        
        These two attachments come with the react library.

        npx create-react-app   -> bulky and takes time

        better way :  using bundler (vite or Parcel) 
        npm create vite@latest
        need to include node_modules -> npm i ;
